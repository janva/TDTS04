The proxyserver application was  developed using g++ compiler on linux and tested using firefox browser. 

INSTALLATION

The application is delivered as C++ source code 0packaged in a compressed file. In order to compile it 
you will need at least a c++ compiler. A makefile is delivered with  sourcecode and we suggest you 
use it to compile the code. See bellow for further instruction on installation and configuration.

Deflate source code into direcotory of your chocie

1) open up shell
2) deflate command proxyserver.zip
3) cd proxydirectory

To compile source you need to be in the source directory and run
4) ./make 

CONFIGURE CONTENT-FILTERING

To filter material you can edit the text file forbidden.txt. Each line in forbidden.txt is
considered as single token to when filtering content. So if we put Britney Spears  only 
pages with only Spears would not be filtered.

RUNNING 

Inside directory where you have installed your application execute following command.

./proxyserver

It's possible to run proxyserver using specific port as well.  If you want for instance 
want to run proxyserver using port 3030 give the following  in your command shell.

./proxyserver 3030

IMPLEMETATION DETAILS

2) Handles simple HTTP GET interactions between client and server

3)Blocks requests for undesirable URLs, using HTTP redirection to display this error page instead

  Filtering is handled in client.cpp using Validator function object which can be found in
  ContentValidator.cpp relevent hints relevant parts in code are marked with //3)

6) Is compatible with all major browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc .) without the requirement to tweak any advanced feature

    *******svar

7) Allows the user to select the proxy port (i.e. the port number should not be hard coded)

   Port number can be configured using giving single argument startup commnand (i.e
   ./proxyserver 3333 would start proxyserver running on port 3333). See code proxyserver.cpp
   marked //7). 

8) Is smart in selection of what HTTP content should be searched for the forbidden keywords. For example, you probably agree that it is not wise to search inside compressed or other non-text-based HTTP content such as graphic files, etc.

   Proxy-server only treats content of type text/plain or text/html see client.cpp code marked //8)
